# swappascrape

Scrape the Swappa page listing for the OnePlus 5t 128GB.

My first webscraper in Python with BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas.

## Purpose:
I broke my OnePlus 5t, and broke it more when I tried to fix it. The phone is already selling for less than I bought it for, but as of today, 9/10/18, the OnePlus 6t is coming out very soon, and the price should drop even more.

This script scrapes the listings and returns information to a CSV, which I can browse to find the best one to buy when prices start to drop.

I've tried to scrape in the past, but never got very far because I did not fully understand it, and without a project in mind, I had no hope of learning to scrape. Now that I have a purpose (finding the best deal on my current favorite phone),
I was able to learn requests, beautifulsoup, and pandas to create the script!
